# SMS-Spam-Detection-using-Natural-Language-Processing and Naive Bayers #

The SMS Spam Detection project classifies messages as "Spam" or "Ham" using NLP and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. Preprocessing included text cleaning, stopword removal, and lemmatization. The model achieved high accuracy, also add a accuracy and model loss, confusion matrix heatmap visualization for enhanced insights.

## Features 

1) Classifies messages as **"Spam"** or **"Ham"**.
2) **Text preprocessing** with cleaning, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
3) Machine learning model trained using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**.
4) **Performance evaluated** with accuracy and confusion matrix.
5) **Enhancement:** Heatmap visualization for insights.
